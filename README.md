BlockScout provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains. This includes the POA Network, xDai Chain, Ethereum Classic and other **Ethereum testnets, private networks and sidechains**.

See our [project documentation](https://docs.blockscout.com/) for detailed information and setup instructions.

Visit the [POA BlockScout forum](https://forum.poa.network/c/blockscout) for FAQs, troubleshooting, and other BlockScout related items. You can also post and answer questions here.

You can also access the dev chatroom on our [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/poanetwork/blockscout).

## About BlockScout

BlockScout is an Elixir application that allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, and verify smart contracts on the Ethereum network including all forks and sidechains.

Currently available full-featured block explorers (Etherscan, Etherchain, Blockchair) are closed systems which are not independently verifiable.  As Ethereum sidechains continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate transactions.

## Supported Projects

BlockScout supports a number of projects. Hosted instances include POA Network, xDai Chain, Ethereum Classic, Sokol & Kovan testnets, and other EVM chains.
